To import a new public key :

1) Locate the key on a key server, eg. pgp.mit.edu.
   For this example, I used Davey Shavik's key, which was used to sign releases starting with PHP 7.1.0beta3.

2) From phpfarm's "src/" directory, run the following command to import the key (substitute 0xF50ABC807BD5DCD0
   with the actual key identifier found in step 1):

   wget -O- 'https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0xF50ABC807BD5DCD0' | \
   gpg --no-default-keyring --primary-keyring ./php.gpg --import -
